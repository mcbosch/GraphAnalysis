# GraphAnalysis
This repository is for practicing on graph analysis and coding GNNs. With the objective of a deep understanding on how a GNN works and how to code one. The main goal is to code a GNN so it can classify a metabolism into different labels. 

I'll start with an theorical understanding and codinng some examples with the PyTorch package so we can see the power of the GNN. Then I'll try to code my own GNN without PyTorch to achive a deep understanding on how it works. 

NOW I'M LEARNING AND PRACTICING FOR THIS REPOSITORY
